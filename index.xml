      <description>On this page I try to fully list all of the books I have read and thought to be noteworthy enough to take on the labourious task of updating this list. I usually read books in digital format first, if they are truly great they will get acquired as a physical copy afterwards. On this list are textbooks as well as novels, fictions and biographys, everyhting I thought was at the least thoughtprovoking.</description>
