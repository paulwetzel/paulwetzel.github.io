On this list are textbooks as well as novels, fictions and biographys, everyhting I thought was at the least thoughtprovoking. Quite obviously I also love reading storys that are simply great fiction with no deepler laying layers, some of them are added here as well.\nI really enjoy reading through others’ lists and browisng theyre Goodread profiles, so this is intented as my version of that for you to take a look at. Some of the books I think are particulary great are flagged with a bold typeface. This list is by no means exhaustive, surley I forgot some great titles I have read years ago.\nFlowers for Algernon (Daniel Keyes): A beautifully written book in the style of a diary on the story of a mentally disabled man who becomes a subject in an experiment that promisis to increase his intelligence.\nAmusing ourself to death (Neil Postman): Long form relevant essay on the effects of media on society, published in 1985 so primarily focused on television but applicable to social media nonetheless or even better.\nThe revolver (Fuminori Nakamura): The story kicks of with the finding of a revolver in a dark Tokio alleyway and revolves around the thoughts surrounding the weapon and potential use.\nThe Trouble with Physics (Lee Smolin): The whole journey from the very first beginnings of what one could consider physics all the way to the modern day, ending with a lengthy discussion off the future. A great read for a holisitc introduction to the state of physics.\nHacking the Xbox (Andrew Huang): For an awesome introduction to the topic of reverse engineering and non intented hardware modifications. Not just a semi technical book: multiple chapters on the social and political issues that come with the topic.\nFrom computer to brain (William Lytton): Comprehensive introduction to the field of computational neurscience that is both suitable for the biology oriented reader as well as someone with a technical background.\nSurely you’re joking Mr. Feynman (Richard Feynman): Great book on a great character! While the lectures on physics surely deserve a spot here as well, I can’t claim to have read and understood them all (yet!). A book on the person who is the personification of curiosity and a must-read.\nThe Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy (Douglas Adams): Hopefully needs no introduction, a marvelous milestone of the sci-fi genre combining great wit, running gags and irony with some underlying far reaching social criticism.\nWatership down (Richard Adams): The most intriguing and though provoking story about rabbits you will ever read.\nOn the Beach (Nevil Shute): A Story about the aftermath of nuclear armageddon, not in the adventuristic fashion of a brave soldier figthing mutant animals but the psychological effect of waiting for the nuclear cloud to reach the last corner of the earth, people coping with their impending death.\nLast Lecture (Randy Pausch): The last lecture of a professor with a look back on his life. Albeit a bit pathetic at times a great read to consider.\nNightfall (Isaac Asimov): Another milestone of sci-fi, a legendary story featuring all the neat elements of sci-fi in it’s best form while entering deep discussions and painting beautiful verbal pictures.\nZero K (Don Delillo): A novel on transhumanism and the overcoming of biological limitations. While sounding like a heavy topic, it is surpirsingly easy to read yeat not dropping in waters to shallow.\nSlaughterhouse-Five (Kurt Vonnegut): An Anti-war novel not focusing on the demise of society, but the demise of one individual. The protagonist tells the story about surviving World War II in a basement of a slaughterhouse pondering episodes of his life while looking at the horrors of war.\nDie Raeuber (Friedrich Schiller): A twist between two brothers on the fate of their fathers kingdom is the best book I have read back in high-school, it remaining relevant to this date despite being over 250 years old. For best experience of some legendary quotes reading the original german version is advised.\nThe Vital Question (Nick Lane): A book on the origins of life from a slightly scientific perspective that still entertains. The origins of life as well as their eveolurion to complex lifeforms that roam the planet today are reverberated and explained, as light as possbiel while still retainign depth.\nJavaScript: The Good Parts (Douglas Crockford): For when you (unfortuantly) have to write JavaScript, I found this to be a good introduction (considering it’s the only book I read on the topic and seemingly this website is still online). While it might not be useful if you want to staet out in programming, if you alredy wrote some code, it will be good.\nA New Kind Of Science (Stephen Wolfram): An absolute log of a book, at 1264 pages this is Stephan Wolfram, whose invention of Wolfram has to make me indefinitly grateful to him, take on his new chapter of “understanding the universe”. I consider reading the entire thing somewhat impossible, skim the sections and dive into the chapters that sound interesting to you.\nMicrocosm: E. Coli and the new science of life (Carl Zimmer): A laymans introduction to molecular biology associated topics that paints an amazing picture of a intricate and complex molecular machine that functions as a model for all life on earth.\nHackers: Heroes of the computer revolution (Stephen Levy): A smiling novel on the aweinspiring jouney of the computer into eveyrday life and the people lifting the process of the ground.\n",
